## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS Framework
- [Framer Motion](https://framer.com/motion/) - For animation


### What I learned

Finally, **Framer Motion** is such a nice library. Once you know how to use it, animating in React becomes *much* more simple.

Say that you wanna add a layout animation. Simply add `Layout` on parent element like this:
```html
<div layout className"...">
  <!-- This is the children elements -->
</div>
```

Now you have a nice animation. Also `variants` is such a nice things to have. Anyway, it's a cool library, you should try it!

### Continued development

I realize I didn't understand about API that much, so in the next challenge, I want to test my API skills if possible.
